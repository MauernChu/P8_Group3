# P8_Group3
This is a repository for the P8 project. The project's goal is to make an application for international parents living in Denmark. The app should make it possible for international parents to socialise when going to public places with their children. The project is a part of the 8. semester project for the master in IT Design and Application Developement at Aalborg University.
